<h2> 🤔 The Problem it solves  </h2>
<p>
Many times it happens that we think about an idea, we discuss it with our friends and get to know their thoughts and opinions over it. But, actually to reach the stage of implementation, we need to make sure that our idea actually has a potential in it + We need to prove our ownership over the idea. The best experiment for testing potential we can do is testing the relevance of ideas for the group of society who will actually benefit with it or to know the constructive opinions of people. At the same time to get the actual opinions one needs to work at ground level which proves to be an hectic task and not remote friendly. So considering this as problem statement for our rescue here comes <b>ideaster (idea + tester)</b  
</p>
